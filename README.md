# Java Basic Programs

This repository contains three basic Java programs that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts. Each program is designed to be simple and easy to understand, and provides a starting point for learning more about Java programming.

## 1. Email Application

The Email Application is a program that generates a company email for a new employee based on their first and last name, department, and a randomly generated password. To run the program, simply execute the Main class. The program prompts the user to enter the employee's name and department, and generates a company email using a standard naming convention. The program also generates a random password and displays it to the user.

## Student Database Managment System

The Java Student Database Application is a console application written in Java that allows users to manage a database of students, enroll them in courses, and keep track of their tuition payments.

The application prompts the user to enter the number of students they want to add to the database, and for each student, it prompts the user to enter their name, grade level, and the courses they want to enroll in. Once a student is enrolled in courses, the application prompts the user to pay the student's tuition.

The application also allows the user to view a student's balance at any time and to pay their tuition.
